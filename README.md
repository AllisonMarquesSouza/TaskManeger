Task Management API

This REST API was developed with NestJS and TypeORM to manage tasks. It allows you to create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks, and is protected by JWT authentication and password encryption with Bcrypt. Additionally, it includes a user service where you can create a user, log in, and receive a JWT token to make requests.

Technologies Used:

- TypeScript: Language for application development.
- NestJS: Framework for Node.js that uses TypeScript.
- TypeORM: ORM library for interacting with databases.
- MySQL: Relational database management system.
- JWT (JSON Web Token): Authentication mechanism.
- Bcrypt: Library for password encryption.
